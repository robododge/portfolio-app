# Portfolio App

This project was built by initializing a blank Next.js 16 app router application, then transforming a Figma design into code using the [Figma MCP server](https://developers.figma.com/docs/figma-mcp-server/local-server-installation/).

The Figma design used for this project is a free community artifact provided by [Anima](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1095695980466714349).
