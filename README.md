# Portfolio App

This project was built by initializing a blank Next.js 16 app router application, then transforming a Figma design into code using the <a href="https://developers.figma.com/docs/figma-mcp-server/local-server-installation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Figma MCP server</a>.

The Figma design used for this project is a free community artifact provided by <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/1095695980466714349" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anima</a>.
